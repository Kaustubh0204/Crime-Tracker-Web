# Crime-Tracker-Web
Interactive and dynamic crime tracking web application.

An ecosystem of various sorts of applications enables the general people to rapidly report a crime that
occurs near them, which can then be easily examined by police and prompted to take appropriate action. Not
only does this minimise discomfort, it also enhances the crime reporting rate. The different types of
analysis also contribute to the repression of serial criminals and enhance local safety by 10 times.

Anyone may use a mobile application to report crime. An app that is publicly available. Then our database
will be notified and shown on the map at the next police station. Police can either handle or close the
report.
